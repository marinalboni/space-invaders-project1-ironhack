Hello all!

Thanks for your attention and for your interest in my game.

I developed this game based on the famous Space Invaders.

My game has two modes:

Levels mode: You have to beat 5 levels before reading the boss (Mr. Potato). Each level has a different grid of enemies.
Infinite mode: You can never win this mode - evety few seconds a new grid of enemies is added and this will go on until you die. The idea is to try to beat your highest scores.

This game was developed as my project for Ironhack, where I'm studying Web Development.

The languages used were HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This is my first README xD so maybe not the best one.

Hope you like the game.

Cheers,
Marina.
